                    Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created
                     by British author <em>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</em>. Known as
                     a &ldquo;consulting detective&rdquo; in the stories, Holmes is known
                     for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and
                     logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he
                     employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of
                     clients, including Scotland Yard. Amongst other foibles,
                     Holmes had a penchant for papier maché.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet),
                      the character's popularity became widespread with the
                      first series of short stories in <em>The Strand Magazine</em>,
                      beginning with &ldquo;A Scandal in Bohemia&rdquo; in 1891; additional
                      tales appeared from then to 1927, eventually totalling
                      four novels and 56 short stories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian
                      periods, taking place between about 1880 to 1914. Most
                      are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and
                      biographer <em>Dr. Watson</em>, who usually accompanies Holmes
                      during his investigations and often shares quarters with
                      him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where
                      many of the stories begin.

                <div class="half">
                  <h1 id="article-header-txt">Doctor Watson</h1>
                  <p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the
                     British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is arguably
                     the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

                  <img src="images/watson.svg" class="mini-img"/>

                  <p>In the debut Holmes story <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, Watson, as
                    the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, their subsequent
                    sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to
                    discover the profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's
                    eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the
                    events surrounding their first case together. Watson
                    describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and
                    sentimental a manner for Holmes' taste. In time, they
                    become close friends.
                  </p>
                  <p>In <em>The Sign of Four</em>, John Watson met
                    <em>Mary Morstan</em>, who became his wife. Mary seemed somewhat less
                    sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him
                    &ldquo;James&rdquo; in the short story &ldquo;The Man with the Twisted Lip&rdquo;.
                    This may be a simple typographical error, though some have
                    speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's
                    unknown middle name, which could have been &ldquo;Hamish&rdquo;
                    (Scottish for &ldquo;James&rdquo;) <em>Dorothy Sayers</em>, creator of the
                    detective <em>Lord Peter Wimsey</em>, also wrote several essays on
                    Holmesian speculation, later published this theory in
                    Unpopular Opinions.

                  <p>
                    Irene Adler, professionally known as &ldquo;The Woman&rdquo;, is a
                    brilliant dominatrix who has an apparently romantic
                    attraction to Sherlock Holmes.
                  </p>

                  <img src="images/irene.svg" class="mini-img"/>

                  <p>
                    Whilst Mycroft is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states
                    that she is a dominatrix who gives out &slquo;recreational
                    scolding&srquo; to people. She has been in the middle of two
                    political scandals in recent years, one of them involving
                    a famous author, in which she had an affair with both
                    sides.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John
                    are summoned to Buckingham Palace by Mycroft and are asked
                    to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken
                    compromising images of a young female member of the British
                    Royal family during a dominatrix session.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Even though Irene does not want money or power for the
                     pictures, Sherlock is tasked in getting them back. She
                     is using them, and other information on her mobile phone,
                     for her &ldquo;protection&rdquo;.

                      abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He
                      sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web,
                      but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well
                      every quiver of each of them. Sherlock Holmes speaking of

                   <p>
                     Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been
                     proven to be the most dangerous of all criminals that
                     Holmes has ever encountered. In the short story
                     &ldquo;The Adventure of the Final Problem&rdquo;, during a fight with
                     Holmes above the Reichenbach Falls, Moriarty fell to his
                     death.
